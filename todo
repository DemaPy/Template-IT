Add possibility to edit and edit content for data field in campaign
HTML to image
Section ordering in template
Components default data


Feature
Create components from components
    -copy placeholders to new component from selected component
    -possibility insert selected component where user want (position)

Currently I save position for content.
(but there is big problem with shifting)
Hello {name} position.
Position for name if 5 symbol.
But what if "l" letter will be deleted/added from/to "Hello" need to shift position for name placeholder.

Problem lies in rely on text but I need some kind of system to manage this (like with slug position inserting)

How to extend text without affecting position of placeholders?
I can create placeholders inside text with data-placeholder-template-it="oi0437n12z0dqncu2"

Questions:
    How manage flexible ways of creating components?
    -what if selected component has lover position than some placeholder
        (
            placeholders for older components shoud have shifting in amount content length of new component 
        )
    -what if component has been removed
        (
            placeholders should have shifting in amount content length of removed component 
        )

When creating nested components there is problems:

-too much clicking
    (
        components should be accessible by click and inserted after CTRL Position selected
    )

-undo action
    (
        remove selected component
    )

-insert component
    (
        placeholders stay with older position
    )
