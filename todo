Add possibility to edit and edit content for data field in campaign
HTML to image
Nested components:

    Current:
        Component with placeholders can be reused multiple times by sections.
            -you don't have to create placeholders every time
        
    Problem:
        But it is very boring and time consuming creating components with placeholders.
        Because 1 component can have 18 placeholders. (and you have to set every placeholder manually)

    Possible way to solve:

        Create component and placeholder with reference to another component.

        Create component and before submitting, click on places where user want attach content from another components.
        -How attach placeholders from referenced component?
        (
            Shifting problem?
            position for new placeholders will be position for content + placeholder position
        )

{
    id
    title
    position
    fallback
}
